	"notes": "R Gang FC are in a different league (they apparently have a couple of ex-academy players). We held them out convincingly for the 1st 10 minutes but once the first went it, then treacled in from then onwards. For the initial 10mins we generated more then they did, but their ability of move the ball around & fitness showed in the end. Great performances from Craig & wingback, & fantastic debut from Giacomo (he was class - a future wingback for Foobar). Not much to take from this game tbh, the lads worked hard."
