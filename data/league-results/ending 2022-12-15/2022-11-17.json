Was also a game of firsts: Matt's first cleansheet, Zak's first hattrick, & Taiga's first(ish) outing at wingback (which he excelled at). We scored our 6 in the first half, so we made some changes & took our foot of the pedal in the 2nd half. Lorenzo was really convincing at CB. I've missed cleansheets."
