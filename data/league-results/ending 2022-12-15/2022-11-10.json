	"notes": "We went with a 2-3-1 based on Lenny not being available [tube strikes] (one of most effective wingbacks) & with our chastening defeat against Deadly Venoms the week previous (which was argued was partially owed to our formation), we felt this game was an opportunity to refreshen up our tactics/formation & experiment with matching up Atleti formation-wise. This was a mistake... as our personel were unfamilar with the 2-3-1 (and the roles that each position requires), & we played most of our players out of position. In-particular, the two CBs were regularly pulled out of position from their wingers using the width the pitch, & our midfields weren't quick/compact enough to fill the spaces in the middle when the CBs were pulled out of shape (classic). Not easy to know how to best of Jonti. He scored a nice goal but beyond that never wanted to pass & rarely linked the midfield with the attack (shame, but he has potiential)."
