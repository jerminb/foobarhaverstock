	"notes": "Finishing with a win is loverly way of concluding the season. We we're at our best, but still getting the win when we're not playing perfectly is a victory within of itself. London FC played with a deepline, which meant we had more possession than we're familiar with, & sometimes struggled to break them down. We often resorted to unnecessary long balls that didn't come to much. The goal we conceded was from a loss of possession from a goalkick that didn't clear there midfield. Great driving from Yomi (he was 9/10), one of the times led to individually well worked goal (also nice he earnt his first PoM award), though there's opportunities for him to work on his cutbacks."
