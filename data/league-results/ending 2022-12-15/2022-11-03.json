	"notes": "A bad day at the office. The 1st half started off evenly, with possession being shared across both teams. Notably though their danger man (Gavin) started in goal). The first half ended 0-2 to them.  2nd half it went down hill fast once Gavin came out of goal & went up front (he scored 5). Disappointing considering we knew he'd be the main threat & yet we still let him score 5 in 20mins. Going forward we need to make sure we aggressively man mark threats better. Again, we really miss Jermin in games like these. Finally, we need to be little comfortable in possession, possibly play with a 2 at the back system against these guys."
