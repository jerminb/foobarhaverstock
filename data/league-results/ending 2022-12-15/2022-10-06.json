	"notes": "McNeeleys got off to an extremely quick start, scoring 2 wondergoals. This put on the backfoot, but we Yomi created an indiviually well work goal. We were down at half time 1-4. 2nd half was better (which we won 2-1). Our passing was shocking (especially in the midfield), needed to look after the ball better. Overall though, not a bad performance, just unfortunate with the goals they scored."
