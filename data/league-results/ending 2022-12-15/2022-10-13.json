	"notes": "Good win. We only had 7 in the end, but Chinese Spice weren't great. Tom was sub if needed but no-one came off and they all did pretty well. Could have been a lot more. We created a lot of chances, either the last shot was off target or we were a touch too slow to pull the trigger. Taiga had a great game up front defensively, pressuring their defenders. He could have got 3-4 goals if he was more clinical. But positive from him. Rajay is excellent. Sign him up. He's skillful, young and full of energy. Tidy player too. Everyone had a good game tbh. Spirits high after a big win. Yomi great value in the team and at the pub!"
