	"notes": "The old derby. We're developing a history against Hackney, & this didn't disappoint. We performed well overall, & having Paz back allowed us retain the ball & dictate play more than we've ever been able to against Hackney (where we usually play deep & rely on repeated long balls over thier midfield). Unfortunately  they translated their few counterattacks to a couple of goals, & we conceded from a corner by being too static. One of the goals we conceded was down to a lack of disapline by lunging in. Got work on minimising those unforced errors. Lovely headed goal from Paz."
