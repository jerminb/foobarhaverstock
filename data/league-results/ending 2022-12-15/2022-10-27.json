	"notes": "An excellent win. We haven't beaten Unprotected Cesc since their first season, so this win marked a big step forward. We marked their key man (Santos) out of the game, & limited him to only 2 goals. Our defensive structure was resolut, expect for a lapse of concentration at a corner (this has become a bit of pattern conceding from corners... we've got to work on that). Yomi, Craig & Len were superb (everyone was excellent, but these lads stood out). Jermin was so solid, & fustrated Santos to the point that a minor skirmish broke out between them (love it). The 3-2-1 is really working, & it beginning to feel the lads familar with one another's runs & cover for each other when a team mate's out of position. This was Fred last game before he travels to New Zealand with gf - we'll miss him. As is becoming a foobar tradition, we team gifted him some spiced rum. Lorenzo was back for this one, and he slotted in liked he'd playing every game... what a player. Great time at the pub afterwards, spirits were high."
