	"notes": "This was one of our most crucial games of the season given that we were joint with Mill Hill pre-match. A win here would of separated us from the mid-pack of team... but unfortunately it wasn't our day. We started really poorly & conceded two in the first 5 minutes (this poor start manifested in our slowness on the ball, with players taking far to many touches... we need to move the ball much quicker!), which really put us on the back foot for the entire game. We clawed our way back to 3-3 just before the halftime but then conceded another just before the halftime whistle. The 2nd half was a melee in which we pushed perilious forward and conceded a handful of goals on the counterattack. Players got caught on the ball occasionally, a couple of which led to goals. On the positive side though we created a lot of opportunities, but characteristically couldn't finish our chances. We missed Craig a lot in this one. Going forward, the team need to move the ball quicker & take fewer touches in general (the keryword here is urgency!)."
