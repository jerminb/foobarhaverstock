	"notes": "Unprotected Cesc is always a tough fixture, and setting up for this one was hard given that there was no recognised centrebacks in our team. Taiga & myself deciced on being the 2 at the back for this one. Santos was a handful, but we contained him reasonably well. Retrospectively, not sure why we didn't man mark him at the outset."
