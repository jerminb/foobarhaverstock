	"notes": "Our a hard one to take, given this was our first loss against London FC. We started out in a 2-3-1, & quickly conceded 3 (first 5mins) & so reverted back to the 3-2-1. We then spent the rest of the game getting back into it & pulled it back to 2-3, but conceded in the final minute from pushing for the 3rd. Very disappointing, feels like a step backward losing against London FC."
