	"notes": "This fixture was a Foobar 7s first of back-to-back matches, with this being the first. Unfortunately, this was one of the sorest loses I think we've ever had. We were 2-3 up until the last minute, until we conceded 2 in the remaning minute. The 2 late goals we conceded were completely avoidable: the first was our backline lunging in & not keeping goalside of thier star CF, the 2nd was sloppy passing that led to a loss of possession in our half. Heartbreaking."
