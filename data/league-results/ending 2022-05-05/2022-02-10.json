	"notes": "This draw felt like a loss (especially as we were 2-0 in the first 10mins). Our performance in possession was generally good; our goals were well worked. We made a few mistakes defensively, one of which led to an own goal. Their other 3 goals were scored by their best player (Zack), all of which we preventable - one was speculative long shot, one was when he was left unmarked for a 1-on-1 & the final was made from an impossible angle. Felt bad for Jermin as he was injured (he was a trooper for even playing). Finally hard one to evaluate since many of our players played out of their positions (Phil CF->CB, Matt GK->CF & Jermin CB->GK). We were shaking passing out from the back & took to many touches."
