	"notes": "Really good performance inspite of the result. We kept our shape well, and cut out a lot of errors (although we did conceded 1 from a crossfield pass which could of been avoided). Harry was particularly good in midfield, and we were promising going forward. 2 goals is the most we've scored against Atleti De Izzy. A small nitpick is that we keep lunging into tackles when we're defending: we should instead stand our ground against attacking players and focus on keeping goalside."
