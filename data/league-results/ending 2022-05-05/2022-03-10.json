	"notes": "We tried to play out from the back, which with hindsight was mistake against Hackney Tropics (where in recent games we've played a long balls that proved quite successful). Our passing was poor & we often lost the ball in our half. Our movement in midfield was static, which made passing harder. Going forward we were good, with some quality finishing from Len & Alkeos."
