	"notes": "Passing & movement was fluid with the front four regularly rotating between themselves. We pressed effectively, but could of pressed a little better in the 1st half.  Our press forced them to play over the top, which led to a couple of their goals (maybe we could of dealt with this better). Sometimes our defenders were outnumbered. Communication was better than last game."
