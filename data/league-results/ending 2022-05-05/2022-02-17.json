	"notes": "Tough game this one. Atleti were organised & pressed us well (our ball recievers were always under pressure). On reflection, we sat off them too much, & didn't create many opportunities. Not a bad team performance though; Alkeos's goal was nicely taken. We possibly need to press when we're in a 2-3-1 formation."
