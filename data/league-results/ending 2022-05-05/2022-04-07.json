	"notes": "Tough one. We set up using a 3-2-1, and we asked our wingbacks to help play out from the back, which meant we were really deep when we had the ball. With hindsight this was a tactical mistake, as it meant we had no forward pass to make. Also a handful of goalkeeping mistakes from long balls that were disappointing."
