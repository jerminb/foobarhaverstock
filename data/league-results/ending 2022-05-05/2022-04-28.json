	"notes": "Another great performance, and a very aggressive game (Two Jills One Nill are bastards). The 3-2-1 formation worked really nicely, and we hung in there even though we went 3-0 down. A couple of unforced errors led to goals (one where we passed a ball to their attacker for a 1-1 with our keeper & another from a long ball over the top). Considering we got thrashed by these guys last game I think we can take a lot of positives from the match. Also, our attacking players probably needed to be a little more clinical (we missed a 1-1's & there were a few other spurned opportunities). Good game overall though... we can build of this."
